# Introduction

Governments and scientists around the world largely agree on the need for a low-carbon electricity production. In the Sustainable Development Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy)[^sdg]. A step in this direction is the construction, installation and connection of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) such as Hydropower, Wind and Solar to the electricity grid. These produce none to little direct emissions while supplying electricity and have life cycle carbon costs far lower than fossil fuels (@LCElectricity). A substrate of RES are so called Variable-RES (VRES), which are electricity sources whose production cannot easily be increased or decreased by the operator. Wind and Solar both rely on meteorological conditions, if these are not right, nothing is produced. This is contrary to most other sources whose production can be increased or decreased according to market needs. Although the time it takes to ramp production up or down can still present a challenge.
[^sdg]: <https://sdgs.un.org/goals> 

The lack of direct control over production with VRES presents a huge challenge to the adoption of such sources, since there is no large scale energy storage available. Battery Storage, Pumped Hydro and Heat Pumps do store energy, but currently these forms of power would not be able to power a country for even a couple of hours.

Worst yet for all energy producer, the addition of electricity from VRES has the possibility to:

1.  Drastically lower electricity prices.
2.  Increase price volatility.

The reason for the first claim is that VRES has practically no marginal costs. No fuel rods, pumping, gas or other notable inputs are required to produce solar and wind energy. This means producers of VRES will bid their energy at almost any price. If they cannot profit - maximize, they will loss - minimize.

The second claim is the case because meteorological events tend to be fairly consistent across an area. When one wind / solar farm is producing, so are the ones around it. This means there is huge downward pressure on prices during periods of favorable VRES production and none at all during unfavorable conditions.

## Relevance

Policymakers would be interested in these results, particularly those countries considering feed-in-tariffs (FIT).

FIT - paying a fixed price for renewable energy, if the price is volatile, government's expenditure will also be.

Consumers of energy (so most people), will also want to know how prices could fluctuate in the future.

Providers of energy storage, who require volatility in prices to make.

## Literature Review

Although generally speaking the academic literature identifies increases V-RES sources as being correlated with volatile prices, it is unclear whether these effects are generalizable to the Swiss grid without further research. A number of studies find an increase in variability as V-RES penetration increases. Amongst them: @pereiradasilva2019 who use EGARCH time series and regression while studying the Iberian power market; @frauendorfer2018 who find that the Swiss are "importing" lower German power prices during peak solar production, as Germany has much more solar energy sources than the Swiss. Finally, the authors @dong2019 find that the Swedish have more stable prices due to the relativley high proportion of non variable fossil and hydropower than the Danes, who are more reliant on V-RES in the form of wind and solar.

Other studies are more conflicted, such as @rintamäki2017 who compare Germany and Danish prices and wind that the effect of increasing wind production on day ahead prices is not constant. They caution that interconnectivity with other grids is important in determining the direction of effect. As such, this is further motivation to study each nation's grid independently, as there may be a large number of variables influencing the price. Although the previously mentioned @frauendorfer2018 paper studies the Swiss grid, it does so in the context of transnational energy trade, and not increases in domestic capacities. This is the gap we are evaluating.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

```{r VRES, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE}


# VRES_percent Range

min_VRES <- min(d.h$VRES_percent, na.rm = TRUE)
max_VRES <- max(d.h$VRES_percent, na.rm = TRUE)

min_VRES
max_VRES


# VRES over Time by Time

ggplot(d.h, aes(x = Timestamp, y = VRES_percent)) + 
  geom_line(color = "blue") + 
  ggtitle("VRES_percent Over Time") +
  xlab("Time") +
  ylab("VRES_percent (%)") +
  theme_minimal()

 
```

The resulting graph displays VRES_percent (Variable Renewable Energy Sources as a percentage of total energy demand) over time. The graph exhibits a cyclical wave pattern, indicating the presence of seasonality, which is expected due to the seasonal nature of wind and solar energy production. This seasonality reflects the fluctuations in renewable energy availability throughout the year.

Toward the end of the graph, there's a noticeable spike or "bump," where the VRES_percent doubles the usual peak levels observed earlier. However, even with this significant increase, the maximum VRES_percent only reaches 0.27% of the total energy demand. This suggests that despite the seasonal variations and occasional spikes, the contribution of renewable energy remains relatively small in the overall energy mix

### VRES

### Visualization

# Convert the Timestamp column to a Date-Time object
d$Timestamp <- as.POSIXct(d$Timestamp, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

# Replace NAs in 'VRES_percent' with zero
d$VRES_percent[is.na(d$VRES_percent)] <- 0

# Convert VRES_percent into a time series object
VRES_ts <- ts(d$VRES_percent, start=c(2015, 1), frequency=24*365.25)  # Assuming hourly data
```

```{r, plot ts of vres percent, echo = FALSE, warning = F}

# Plot time series of VRES percent
ggplot(d, aes(x = Timestamp)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = VRES_ts, color = "VRES Percent", size = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Time Series of Variable Renewable Energy Sources Percentage",
       x = NULL,
       y = "VRES") +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = VRES_ts, color = "Linear Trend"), 
              method = "lm",

  scale_color_manual(name = "VRES", 
                     values = c("VRES Percent" = "purple", "Linear Trend" = "orange"))
```

### Decomposition and Stationarity

```{r, vres additive decomposition, echo = FALSE, warning = F}

# Decompose the time series

plot(VRES_decomposed)
```

```{r, vres adf1, echo = FALSE, warning = F}

# Perform Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
adf.test(VRES_ts)

The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test has a p-value of 0.01 although the decomposition clearly shows a trend, seasonality and also a change in randomness. We suspect a decomposition of a multiplicative time series might help. A multiplicative decomposition assumes that the components (trend, seasonality, and noise) interact in a multiplicative manner. This is often suitable when the variability of the series increases as the level of the series increases, which might be indicated by the trend and seasonal patterns scaling with the overall level.

Applying a log transformation to the data can stabilize the variance, which often makes the series more amenable to decomposition or modeling. The log transformation essentially converts a multiplicative relationship into an additive one.

```{r, vres multiplicative decomposition, echo = FALSE, warning = F}

# Apply log transformation (add a small constant to avoid log(0) issues)
VRES_log <- log(VRES_ts + 1e-6)

# Decompose the log-transformed time series
VRES_log_decomposed <- decompose(VRES_log)
plot(VRES_log_decomposed)
```

```{r, vres adf2, echo = FALSE, warning = F}

# Perform Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
adf.test(VRES_log)
```

## Time Series of Daily Benchmark Data

### Daily VRES and non-VRES Production

#### 1. Visualization

```{r, sun and wind visualization, echo = FALSE, warning = F}

ggplot(d.d %>%
         select(Date, Photovoltaic_GWh, Wind_GWh) %>%
         pivot_longer(cols = c(Photovoltaic_GWh, Wind_GWh), 
                      names_to = "Source", 
                      values_to = "GWh"), 
       aes(x = as.Date(Date), y = GWh, color = Source)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Time Series of Photovoltaic and Wind Energy Production",
       x = NULL, y = "Energy Production (GWh)") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Photovoltaic_GWh" = "orange", "Wind_GWh" = "darkgrey")) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year", date_labels = "%Y")
```

The first graph illustrates the evolution of photovoltaic and wind energy production over time. Photovoltaic production (in orange) exhibits a clear seasonal pattern, with higher output during the summer months and lower production in winter, reflecting the natural variation in solar energy availability. In contrast, Wind production (in grey) remains consistently low throughout the year with some fluctuations but no clear trend, indicating that wind energy may play a relatively small role in the overall energy production mix compared to photovoltaic energy.

```{r, vres visualization, echo = FALSE, warning = F}

ggplot(d.d %>%
         select(Date, VRES_GWh, Non_VRES_GWh) %>%
         pivot_longer(cols = c(VRES_GWh, Non_VRES_GWh), 
                      names_to = "Source", 
                      values_to = "GWh"), 
       aes(x = as.Date(Date), y = GWh, color = Source)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Time Series of VRES and Non-VRES Production",
       x = NULL, y = "Energy Production (GWh)") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("VRES_GWh" = "darkgreen", "Non_VRES_GWh" = "black")) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year", date_labels = "%Y")
```

The second graph compares VRES (Variable Renewable Energy Sources, including Photovoltaic and Wind) with Non-VRES (comprising Hydro, Nuclear, Storage, and Thermal energy). The Non-VRES sources (in black) dominate total energy production and display significant variability over time, driven by factors such as fluctuating demand and adjustments in non-renewable energy generation. VRES production (in green), while much lower in magnitude, shows a clear seasonal trend, largely driven by photovoltaic energy, with peaks in the summer months.

#### 2. Decomposition of Daily VRES Production

```{r, decomposition, echo = FALSE, warning = F}
# Create a time series object for VRES production (Photovoltaic + Wind)
vres_ts_d <- ts(d.d$VRES_GWh, start = c(2017, 1), frequency = 365)

# Decompose the VRES time series
vres_decomp_d <- decompose(vres_ts_d)
plot(vres_decomp_d, xlab = NULL)

# Check the first few values of each component
head(vres_decomp_d$trend)
head(vres_decomp_d$seasonal)
head(vres_decomp_d$random)
```

The decomposition reveals a clear linear trend and strong seasonal patterns, with some variability in both the seasonal component and residuals. While the seasonal noise is expected due to the nature of renewable energy sources like photovoltaic and wind, it does not obscure the overall pattern. The fluctuations in the residuals suggest potential volatility of variance, but this can be addressed by examining the residuals further after modeling.

#### 3. Stationarity and Differencing Daily VRES Production

First, we apply regular differencing to remove the linear trend and since there is seasonality, we also apply seasonal differencing.

```{r, differencing, echo = FALSE, warning = F}
# Apply first-order differencing to make the series stationary
diff_vres_ts_d <- diff(vres_ts_d)

# Apply seasonal differencing (assume seasonal frequency = 365 for daily data with yearly seasonality)
seasonal_diff_vres_ts_d <- diff(diff_vres_ts_d, lag = 365)
```

```{r, plot differencing, echo = FALSE, warning = F}
# Set up the plot window to display two plots side by side
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))

# Plot the differenced series
plot(diff_vres_ts_d, main="Differenced VRES Time Series", 
     ylab = "Differenced GWh", 
     xlab = NULL)

# Plot the seasonally differenced series
plot(seasonal_diff_vres_ts_d, main="Seasonally Differenced VRES Time Series", 
     ylab = "Differenced GWh", 
     xlab = NULL)

# Reset to the default single plot layout
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

The first plot (Differenced VRES Time Series) shows the series after first-order differencing. While the trend is largely removed, there still appears to be seasonal fluctuations in the data, suggesting that seasonal differencing may be necessary.The variance seems somewhat stable, but there is some volatility toward the latter half of the series.

The second plot (Seasonally Differenced VRES Time Series) shows the data after applying both first-order and seasonal differencing. The seasonality appears to be removed successfully. The variance still shows some volatility, particularly in the later years, but the overall pattern is more stable than the first-differenced series.

```{r, vres stationarity, echo = FALSE, warning = F}
# Perform ADF test to check stationarity
adf.test(seasonal_diff_vres_ts_d)
```

```{r, log-differencing, echo = FALSE, warning = F}
# Apply log transformation to the original VRES series
log_vres_ts_d <- diff(vres_ts_d)

# Apply differencing to the log-transformed series
diff_log_vres_ts_d <- diff(log_vres_ts_d)
seasonal_diff_log_vres_ts_d <- diff(diff_log_vres_ts_d, lag = 365)

# Plot the seasonally differenced log-transformed series
plot(seasonal_diff_log_vres_ts_d, main="Seasonally Differenced Log-Transformed VRES Time Series", 
     ylab="Log-Differenced GWh", 
     xlab = NULL)

```

The log-transformation and seasonal differencing have not sufficiently stabilized the variance, this indicates that the series may still exhibit heteroscedasticity (i.e., non-constant variance) which is why we consider a GARCH model.

```{r warning=FALSE, vres garch, echo=FALSE}

# Specify the model for the mean
spec <- ugarchspec(variance.model = list(model = "sGARCH", garchOrder = c(1, 1)),
                   mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(1, 1)),
                   distribution.model = "norm")

# Fit the GARCH model to the log-differenced series
fit_garch <- ugarchfit(spec = spec, data = seasonal_diff_log_vres_ts_d)

# Summary of the fitted GARCH model
summary(fit_garch)

# Plot the fitted volatility
plot(fit_garch, which = 2)  # This will show the conditional variance (volatility)

# Forecast using the fitted GARCH model
garch_forecast <- ugarchforecast(fit_garch, n.ahead = 365)

# Plot the forecasted volatility
plot(garch_forecast, which = 1)  # Forecasted series
plot(garch_forecast, which = 3)  # Forecasted conditional variance

```

#### 4. Forecast of Daily VRES Production

Let's resume with the ACF and PACF since the GARCH model does not yield the desired result.

```{r, acf pacf, echo = FALSE, warning = F}
# ACF and PACF for the log-transformed differenced series
acf(seasonal_diff_vres_ts_d)
pacf(seasonal_diff_vres_ts_d)
```

```{r, acf pacf, echo = FALSE, warning = F}

# Fit a SARIMA model with auto.arima to handle seasonality
sarima_model <- auto.arima(vres_ts_d, seasonal = TRUE)

# Summary of the fitted model
summary(sarima_model)

# Check residuals of the SARIMA model
checkresiduals(sarima_model)

# Forecast the next 365 days (or another period)
sarima_forecast <- forecast(sarima_model, h = 500)

# Plot the forecast
plot(sarima_forecast, main="SARIMA Forecast for VRES Time Series")

# Visualize the SARIMA forecast with confidence intervals
autoplot(sarima_forecast) +
  ggtitle("SARIMA Forecast for VRES Time Series") +
  xlab("Date") +
  ylab("Energy Production (GWh)")
```

# Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and random components
decomp_baseload <- decompose(baseload_ts)

# Plot the decomposition
plot(decomp_baseload)

```


#### 3. Stationarity and Differencing of Day-Ahead Prices

```{r, differencing of day-ahead, echo = FALSE, warning = F}

# Apply seasonal differencing (assuming yearly seasonality with a frequency of 365)
seasonal_diff_baseload_ts <- diff(diff_baseload_ts, lag = 365)

# Plot the seasonally differenced series
plot(seasonal_diff_baseload_ts, main="Seasonally Differenced Baseload Time Series")

```


#### 4. Forecast of Day-Ahead Prices

# Fit SARIMA model using auto.arima
sarima_model_prices <- auto.arima(baseload_ts, seasonal = TRUE)

# Summary of the fitted SARIMA model

```

Suggest 2-3 models, done well. This means verifying the assumptions and making neccesary transformation. I suggest doing the results in a seperate section
