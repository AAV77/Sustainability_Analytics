  abstract = {Control power (regulating power, balancing power) is used to quickly restore the supply-demand balance in power systems. Variable renewable energy sources (VRE) such as wind and solar power are often thought to increase the reserve requirement significantly. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of balancing systems in Europe, discusses the role of VRE, and presents empirical market data from Germany. Despite German VRE capacity doubled during the last five years and has surpassed 70\% of peak load, contracted control power decreased by 20\%, and procurement cost fell by 50\%. Today, control power adds only 0.4\% to household electricity prices. Nevertheless, we identify several sources of inefficiency in control power markets and imbalance settlement systems and propose a number of policy changes to stimulate the participation of VRE in control provision and to improve the incentives to forecast accurately.},

  abstract = {We report a potential self-reinforcing design flaw in the variable market premium scheme that occurs if variable renewable energy power plants receiving a premium become price-setting in the market. A high share of renewable energy is a goal of many countries on their transformation path to a sustainable future. Accordingly, policies like feed-in tariffs have been in place for many years in many countries to support investment. To foster market alignment, variable market premia have been introduced in at least 12 European countries and a further dozen additional countries worldwide. We demonstrate both with a mathematical model and different scenarios of an agent-based simulation that the combination of variable premia and a high share of hours in which renewables are price-setting may lead to a self-reinforcing downward spiral of prices if unchecked. This is caused by the market premium opening up the bidding space towards negative prices. We discuss possible objections and countermeasures and evaluate the severity of this market design flaw.},
